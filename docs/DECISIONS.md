# Decisions

One line per decision, with the reason. Read this before re-opening a settled question.

- **Scope: Danish straits (historical) + Gibraltar/Ceuta (live).** Denmark gives years of free
  history over a chokepoint all Baltic oil must transit; Gibraltar/Ceuta is a documented
  ship-to-ship transfer node. One method, two independent theatres — proves it generalises.
- **Detectors are rules, not models.** They work from day one without labels and their reasoning is
  inspectable. Models only rank what the detectors find.
- **Isolation Forest + LightGBM only.** Both have a long track record on this shape of problem.
  Trajectory autoencoders and similar are explicitly out of the main path: high risk of burning
  weeks for nothing. Optional extension once everything else is finished.
- **Forward-looking validation is the headline result.** Train before cutoff `T`, evaluate only on
  designations published after `T`. Anything else is circular.
- **Storage: Parquet + DuckDB.** Handles tens of millions of positions with no database server, and
  keeps raw data out of the context window.
- **Flat package layout (`ingest/`, `process/`, …) and `requirements.txt`.** Matches the convention
  already used across the author's other portfolio repositories.
- **Label bias gets its own README section.** Sanctioned vessels are the ones that were *caught*,
  not all offenders. Training on that label partly teaches the sanctioner's criteria. Saying so
  precisely is worth more than a decimal point of precision.
